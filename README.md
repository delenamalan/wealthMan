## Introduction

WealthMan is a Meteor application for wealth managers to maintain their models
and securities. I wrote it for a job application and to practice and showcase my
skills in Meteor, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Meteor is an open-source JavaScript web-application framework written on top of
Node.js and is described as as a MVM (Model-View-Mapper).

## How to run

If you don't have Meteor installed already, from a terminal window:
    curl install.meteor.com | /bin/sh

To run the app:
    cd wealthMan
    meteor

Open your browser (preferably Chrome) and type http://localhost:3000 in the
address bar.

Type any email address and password to login.

The latest version of the app is also running at http://wealthman.meteor.com
